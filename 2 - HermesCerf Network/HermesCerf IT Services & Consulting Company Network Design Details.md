# HermesCerf IT Services & Consulting Company Design Details

The HermesCerf IT Service & Consulting is a medium-sized IT services and consulting firm that operates from a 2-floor office with almost a 100 employees.

The network supports departmental VLANs, dynamic routing with OSPF, and VLSM-based efficient IP addressing. The physical topology showcases redundant edge routers and the utilization of a collapsed core model, with the edge routers feeding into two core multilayer switches, and distributed via location-based division access switches per floor.
